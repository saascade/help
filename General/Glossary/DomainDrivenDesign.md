To oversimplify things, Domain-Driven Design is the recommended approach for creating Enterprise-grade software applications.
This is because it allows the structure and lanaguage in the code to match what is actually used in the business - making it much easier to reason about complex (or even simple) software systems. It's about creating a language that is shared between domain/business experts and technical experts. We then use that shared language to model the business in a user-friendly, but technically complete way - reducing a lot of the risk, while also speeding up the software development.



When you are trying to build complex software it is extremely important that everyone is on the same page!
The software itself should represent the business and it should be clear from the code how the business functions. 
Software development is difficult enough without the business and engineering using different names for the same thing.

This is where Domain Driven Design (DDD) comes in, which was made popular by Eric Evans in his 2003 book Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software.


The SAAScade platform takes things further by providing tools to easily do the modelling, generate the code and manage the resulting software systems - effectively eliminating or reducing a lot of the risk and complexity of trying to do this manually.
